romania.2.t:0 "The fate of Corneliu Vadim Tudor"
romania.2.d:0 "Recent events in Bucharest have shocked the world, as Tudor Ionescu has taken over the city with the help of armed militias and detachments of the army. Meanwhile, at Cotroceni, the presidential palace, the fate of Corneliu Vadim Tudor is being decided by the 30th Guards Regiment, the oldest unit in the Romanian army, which is trying to defend the institution from legionary forces. The Cotroceni Palace has great historical value, starting as a monastery in the 1680s, becoming the residence of the first prince of united Romania, Alexandru Ioan Cuza in 1862. In the 1880s king Carol I built a modern palace within the walls of the monastery. The palace hosted the 1916 Crown Council, that voted for Romania's entry into WW1, and during the communist era it became the Pioneer's Palace, the headquarters of Romania's own boy scouts organisation. The old monastery church, demolished in 1984, had numerous hidden passage ways leading to different churches throughout the city, but also out to the valley of the Dambovita river, outside the city, not to mention the hidden rooms and corridors within the walls added by the communists. It is rumoured that these secret chambers and passages may still exist, and could be the president's only escape route."
