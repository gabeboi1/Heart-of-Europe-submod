ROM_legionaryrebellion_desc:0 "The alliance between Vadim Tudor and prime minister Ionescu cannot go on further, if we are to establish the National Legionary state that Codreanu dreamed of. We shall end this unholy alliance as the Legion ended their enemies in the glorious night of November 28th, 1940, thru blood and fire! Nobody can stand in our way anymore, and we will make sure of it!"
